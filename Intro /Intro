# 📐 Triangle-Solver 📐
A simple program I made to finish my math homework faster because I wanted more time for learning computer science. 😊
I don't suggest anyone to actually use this unless they literally NEED it. Your homework's important if u want to get smarter, especially when it comes to math.

Note: This project isn't finished yet. There's definitely much more features and optimisations to implement.

Make sure to read the comments around the end of the script if u want to understand how to use it.
